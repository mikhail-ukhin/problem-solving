# Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example:

# Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
#              received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
#              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
#              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
# Note:

# If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
